# Simple-Grid-Photo-Gallery
Simple web gallery implemented in PHP and Javascript.

Presents photos in grid style like Pinterest or like Google Keep presents notes. 
Uses infinity scroll which enables fast initial page load, but adds photos as user scroll down. 
Mobile friendly.
Supports presenting photos in full screen mode.

Thumbnails should be stored in folder 'thumbs', while photos for full screen presentation should be stored in folder 'fullscreen'.
